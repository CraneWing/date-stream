# TimeStamper 

## (A Timestamp Microservice)

This is the first "Basejump" challenge in FreeCodeCamp's Full Stack Developer Series. It was designed for the student to "get their feet wet," so to speak, working with Node.js and Express.js and the concept of a single-page app.

All the app does is take a string and evaluate if it is a valid date string in natural language ("February 8, 2016"), ISO ("2016-02-08") or Unix (1454889600). If the string is a date, it will return an object with date rendered in both Unix and natural language. If not, both Unix and natural language values will be null.
